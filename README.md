## Setup

**Requirements**: [Node](https://nodejs.org), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [git](https://git-scm.com/), [python3.6 or later](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/), [invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/installing.html).

If you installed [Python with Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python), use `pip3 install` instead of `pip install` when installing the relevant requirements.

### Check your environment

- `python --version` should return 3.6 or higher,
- `pipenv --version` should return 11.10 or higher,
- `invoke --version` should return 0.22.1 or higher.

### Setup steps

Run the following terminal commands to get started:

- `git clone https://github.com/mozilla/foundation.mozilla.org.git`
- `cd foundation.mozilla.org`
- `inv setup`

If you're on windows, you need an extra step: run `inv manage createsuperuser` to create an admin user.

You're done :tada:

## Development

### Pipenv and Invoke commands

Pipenv pattern to run Django management commands is:

- `pipenv run python [path to manage.py] [manage.py command] [options]`

For example, you can run your development server that way:

- `pipenv run python network-api/manage.py runserver`

But it's a bit long. So instead, you can use invoke:

- `inv runserver`

#### Invoke tasks available:

- `inv -l`: list available invoke tasks
- `inv makemigrations`: Creates new migration(s) for apps
- `inv migrate`: Updates database schema
- `inv runserver`: Start a web server
- `inv setup`: Prepare your dev environment after a fresh git clone
- `inv test`: Run tests
- `inv catch-up`: Install dependencies and apply migrations

For management commands not covered by an invoke tasks, use `inv manage [command]` (example: `inv manage load_fake_data`). You can pass flag and options to management commands using `inv manage [command] -o [positional argument] -f [optional argument]`. For example:
- `inv manage runserver -o 3000`
- `inv manage load_fake_data -f seed=VALUE`
- `inv manage migrate -o news`

### Generating a new set of fake model data

By default, your dev site will use production data (read only!). To load fake model data into your dev site:

- Run `inv manage load_fake_data`
- Replace `NETWORK_SITE_URL` value by `http://localhost:8000` in your `.env` file.

You can empty your database and create a full new set of fake model data using the following command

- `pipenv run python network-api/manage.py load_fake_data --delete`

You can generate a specific set of fake model data by entering a seed value

- `pipenv run python network-api/manage.py --delete --seed VALUE`

If a seed is not provided, a pseudorandom one will be generated and logged to the console. You can share this value with others if you need them to generate the same set of data that you have.

#### Landing Page and Campaign links

The `load_fake_data` command will output pages with the following slugs:

- `/`
- `/about/`
- `/styleguide/`
- `/people/`
- `/news/`
- `/initiatives/`
- `/campaigns/single-page/`
- `/campaigns/multi-page/`
- `/opportunity/single-page/`
- `/opportunity/multi-page/`

This list is available on review apps by clicking on `DEV HELP` in the menu or going to `[review app url]/help`.

### Using a copy of the production database for critical testing

Some development work requires testing changes against "whatever the current production database looks like", which requires having postgresql installed locally (`brew install postgresql` on mac; download and run the official installer for windowsl; if you use linux/unix, you know how to install things for your favourite flavour, so just do that for postgresql).

The steps involved in cloning the production database for local use are as follows:

1) grab a copy of the production database by running `pg_dump DATABASE_URL > foundation.psql` on the commandline. In this, `DATABASE_URL` is a placeholder, and you will want to replace it with the value found for the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable that is used on heroku, for the production instance.

This will take a little while, but once the operation  finishes, open `foundation.psql` in your favourite text/code editor and take note of who the owner is by looking for the following statements:

```
SET search_path = public, pg_catalog;

--
-- Name: clean_user_data(); Type: FUNCTION; Schema: public; Owner: ...... <= we want to know this string
--
```

2) Run `createdb foundation` on the command line so that you have a postgresql database to work with. If you get an error that you already have a database called `foundation`, either create a new database with a new name (and then use that name in the next steps) or delete the old database using `dropdb foundation` before issuing `createdb foundation`.

3) Run `psql foundation` on the command line to connect to that database.

4) Run `CREATE ROLE TheOwnerNameFromTheDBdump WITH SUPERUSER;` in the postgresql command line interface, making sure to have that semi-colon at the end, and making sure NOT to quote the owner name string.

5) Run `\i foundation.psql` in the postgresql command line interface to import the `foundation` database content. Once this finishes you will have an exact copy of the production database set up for local testing.

You will now also need to update your `.env` file to make sure you're using this database, setting `DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/foundation`.

If you need to reset this database, rerun step 2 (with `dropdb foundation` as first command) through 5 to get back to a clean copy of the production database.


### Resolving conflicting Django migrations

**AKA: What to do when a migration lands before yours**

- Create a new, separate local instance of `foundation` per "Setup steps" above.
- Check out your new PR branch locally.
- Delete *all* your PR's migrations and commit the deletion.
- Run `inv makemigrations`
- Commit the newly generated migration.
- Run `inv migrate` to verify and run new migration.
- Push changes to your PR branch.

### Running the project for front-end development

- At the root of the project you can run: `npm start`, which will start the server as well as watch tasks for recompiling changes to JS(X) and Sass files.

### Tests

When relevant, we encourage you to write tests.
You can run the tests using the following command

- `inv test`

### Stack

#### HTML

HTML for the majority of the site is generated from Django/Wagtail templates and components.

#### CSS

CSS is generated from [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). The [Mofo Bootstrap](https://github.com/mozilla/mofo-bootstrap) theme is pulled in by default.

#### React

React is used *à la carte* for isolated component instances (eg: a tab switcher) since this is not a single page application, but rather a static generated website. This precludes the need for Flux architecture, or such libraries as React Router.

To add a React component, you can target a container element from `/source/js/main.js` and inject it.

#### Django and Mezzanine

Django powers the backend of the site, and we use Mezzanine with Django to provide CMS features and functionality.

## Development

This project is based on [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/), which is itself based on Django, so the documentation for both projects applies.
 If you're new to Django, Django official documentation provide a [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/) and a handful of [topics](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/) and [how-to](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/howto/) guides to help you get started. If you're completely new to programming, check
 [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) tutorial.

### Pipenv workflow

Checking [Pipenv documentation](https://docs.pipenv.org/) is highly recommended if you're new to it.

#### Virtual environment

- `pipenv shell` activates your virtual environment and automatically loads your `.env`. Run `exit` to leave it. You don't need to be in your virtual environment to run python commands: Use `pipenv run python [...]` instead.

#### Installing dependencies

- `pipenv install [package name]`

After installing a package, pipenv automatically runs a `pipenv lock` that updates the `pipfile.lock`. You need to add both `pipfile` and `pipfile.lock` to your commit.

#### Updating dependencies

- `pipenv update --outdated` to list dependencies that need to be updated,
- `pipenv update` to update dependencies

If a dependency is updated, pipenv automatically runs a `pipenv lock` that updates the `pipfile.lock`. You need to add both `pipfile` and `pipfile.lock` to your commit.

#### Listing installed dependencies

- `pipenv graph`

### Overriding templates and static content

Sometimes it is necessary to override templates or static js/css/etc assets. In order to track *what* we changed in these files please surround your changes with:

```
# override: start #123
... override code here...
# override: end #123
```

Where `#...` is an issue number pointing to the issue that these changes are being made for.

### Gotchas

As this is REST API and CMS built on top of Django, there are some "gotcha!"s to keep in mind due to the high level of magic in the Django code base (where things will happen automatically without the code explicitly telling you).

#### **DEBUG=True**

The `DEBUG` flag does all sorts of magical things, to the point where testing with debugging turned on effectively runs a completely different setup compared to testing with debugging turned off. When debugging is on, the following things happen:

- Django uses its own built-in static content server, in which template tags may behave *differently* from the Mezzanine static server, which can lead to `400 Bad Request` errors in `DEBUG=False` setting.
- Django bypasses the `ALLOWED_HOST` restrictions, which again can lead to `400 Bad Request` errors in `DEBUG=False` setting.
- Rather than HTTP error pages, Django will generate stack traces pages that expose pretty much all environment variables except any that match certain substrings such as `KEY`, `PASS`, etc. for obvious security reasons.
- ...there are probably more gotchas just for `DEBUG` so if you find any please add them to this list.

#### Use of `{ static "...." }` in templates

Using the `static` tag in templates is supposed both in Django and Mezzanine, but they work differently: in Django, `{static "/..." }` works fine, but in Mezzanine this is a breaking pattern and there **should not** be a leading slash: `{ static "..." }`.

### Deployment

#### Review Apps

Opening a PR will automatically create a Review App in the `foundation-site` pipeline. It's not possible to use OAuth but you can still access the admin with `admin` as the username. Login are published in the `mofo-review-apps` Slack channel when the review app is ready.

##### Environment Variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GITHUB API authentication,
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_RA`: Webhook to `mofo-review-apps`

#### Staging

Builds to staging are triggered by commits to `master`.

Staging URL is [foundation.mofostaging.net](https://foundation.mofostaging.net)

#### Production

Production deployments are done by promoting Staging in the Heroku pipeline.

Production URL is [foundation.mozilla.org](https://foundation.mozilla.org)

##### Domain Redirect

Enable domain redirection by setting `DOMAIN_REDIRECT_MIDDLWARE_ENABLED` to `True`. This will enable a middleware function that checks every request, and return a 307 redirect to `TARGET_DOMAIN` if the host header does not match it.

---

### Environment Variables

Default environment variables are declared in `env.default`. If you wish to override any of the values, you can create a local `.env` file in the root of the project. This file should not be committed.

The domain used to fetch static content from Network Pulse can be customized by specifying `PULSE_API_DOMAIN`. By default it uses `network-pulse-api-production.herokuapp.com`.

The URL for fetching static content from the Network API can be customized by specifying `NETWORK_SITE_URL`. By default it uses `https://foundation.mozilla.org`. **NOTE: this variable must include a protocol (such as `https://`)**

---

### Scheduled tasks

#### Delete non-staff management command

Every sunday, a script runs on prod dyno to remove non-staff accounts created on the Foundation site. An account is considered staff if one of those conditions is true:
- it's an `@mozillafoundation.org` email,
- `is_staff` is at True,
- the account is in a group.

---
### Security

[https://snyk.io](https://snyk.io) is used to test our npm and PyPi dependencies for vulnerabilities. These tests are run on Travis and Appveyor, and will cause a build to fail when a new vulnerability is detected.

#### Resolving an issue

If an issue is reported by Snyk, you have several options to remedy the problem. Firstly, the build log should contain a link to the vulnerability report on snyk.io. On that page you will find links to the issue or CVE, and information about how to resolve the problem. You should start a new feature branch and pull request to resolve this issue before merging any other features.

#### Unpatched vulnerabilities
In some cases, vulnerabilities have not been patched - you will need to look at the nature of the issue and then add an exception to the `.snyk` file for it. You can install the snyk cli using `npm install -g snyk` and add the exception like so: `snyk ignore --id="SNYK-PYTHON-BOTO3-40617" --expiry="2017-12-31" --reason="No fix available"` (Replace the `id` and `reason` with relevant information). The `expiry` flag is an [RFC2822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14) formatted date string that will cause the ignore rule to expire - useful so that we can check periodically for fixes to unpatched vulnerabilities in our dependencies.
