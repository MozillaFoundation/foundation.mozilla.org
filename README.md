## Setup

**Requirements**: [Node](https://nodejs.org), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [git](https://git-scm.com/), [python3.6 or later](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/), [invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/installing.html).

If you installed [Python with Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python), use `pip3 install` instead of `pip install` when installing the relevant requirements.

### Check your environment

- `python --version` should return 3.6 or higher,
- `pipenv --version` should return 11.10 or higher,
- `invoke --version` should return 0.22.1 or higher.

### Setup steps

Run the following terminal commands to get started:

- `git clone https://github.com/mozilla/foundation.mozilla.org.git`
- `cd foundation.mozilla.org`
- `inv setup`

If you're on windows, you need an extra step: run `inv manage createsuperuser` to create an admin user.

You're done :tada:

To catch up on new dependencies, migrations, etc. after initial setup, you can use the `inv catch-up` command.


## Testing

When relevant, we encourage you to write tests. You can run the tests using the following command

- `inv test`

In addition to the code tests there are also visual regression tests, located in the `./cypress/integration` directory. You can run these tests locally by installing [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) using `npm i cypress@3.0.3`, after which the command `npm run cypress` will run these tests locally. However, note that these tests are currently intended for screenshot comparisons across branches, and so will not yield any meaningful results when run for a single branch.





## Security

[https://snyk.io](https://snyk.io) is used to test our npm and PyPi dependencies for vulnerabilities. These tests are run on Travis and Appveyor, and will cause a build to fail when a new vulnerability is detected.

### Resolving an issue

If an issue is reported by Snyk, you have several options to remedy the problem. Firstly, the build log should contain a link to the vulnerability report on snyk.io. On that page you will find links to the issue or CVE, and information about how to resolve the problem. You should start a new feature branch and pull request to resolve this issue before merging any other features.

### Unpatched vulnerabilities
In some cases, vulnerabilities have not been patched - you will need to look at the nature of the issue and then add an exception to the `.snyk` file for it. You can install the snyk cli using `npm install -g snyk` and add the exception like so: `snyk ignore --id="SNYK-PYTHON-BOTO3-40617" --expiry="2017-12-31" --reason="No fix available"` (Replace the `id` and `reason` with relevant information). The `expiry` flag is an [RFC2822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14) formatted date string that will cause the ignore rule to expire - useful so that we can check periodically for fixes to unpatched vulnerabilities in our dependencies.

## Gotchas

As this is REST API and CMS built on top of Django, there are some "gotcha!"s to keep in mind due to the high level of magic in the Django code base (where things will happen automatically without the code explicitly telling you).

#### **DEBUG=True**

The `DEBUG` flag does all sorts of magical things, to the point where testing with debugging turned on effectively runs a completely different setup compared to testing with debugging turned off. When debugging is on, the following things happen:

- Django bypasses the `ALLOWED_HOST` restrictions, which again can lead to `400 Bad Request` errors in `DEBUG=False` setting.
- Rather than HTTP error pages, Django will generate stack traces pages that expose pretty much all environment variables except any that match certain substrings such as `KEY`, `PASS`, etc. for obvious security reasons.
- ...there are probably more gotchas just for `DEBUG` so if you find any please add them to this list.
