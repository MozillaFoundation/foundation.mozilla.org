- [x] land Playwright testing
- [x] create PNI search test(s)
- [x] move all `init()` calls out as plain functions
- [-] move all "object functions" in search over as (temporary) "class functions"
 (WE ARE NOW HERE)
- [ ] updated faker to include subcategories for a PNI main category.
- [ ] update tests to check for subcategory behaviour.
- [ ] continue the refactor
- [ ] move all "can be moved to utils" functions into their own (possibly more than one) util modules
- [ ] move the setupXYZ functions back into the class
- [ ] we should be done with the initial refactor now
