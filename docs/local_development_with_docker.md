# Docker for Local Dev Documentation

This documentation is composed of three main sections:
- [How to install and use Docker for local development](./local_development_with_docker.md#how-to-use)
- [Connecting Docker to your code editor](./local_development_with_docker.md#connecting-docker-to-your-code-editor)
- [Docker 101 and how we use it with the foundation site](./local_development_with_docker.md#docker-vocabulary-and-overview). Start here if you're new to Docker
- [FAQ](./local_development_with_docker.md#faq)

## How to use

To interact with the project, you can use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) CLIs or use shortcuts with invoke.

The general workflow is:
- Install the project with `invoke docker-new-env`,
- Run the project with `docker-compose up`,
- Log into the admin site with username `admin` and password `admin`,
- Use invoke commands for frequent development tasks (database migrations, dependencies install, run tests, etc),
- After doing a `git pull`, keep your clone up to date by running `invoke docker-catchup`.

### Invoke commands

 To get a list of invoke commands available, run `invoke -l`:

```
  docker-catch-up (docker-catchup)   Rebuild images and apply migrations
  docker-l10n-sync                   Sync localizable fields in the database
  docker-l10n-update                 Update localizable field data (copies from original unlocalized to default localized field)
  docker-makemigrations              Creates new migration(s) for apps
  docker-manage                      Shorthand to manage.py. inv docker.manage "[COMMAND] [ARG]"
  docker-migrate                     Updates database schema
  docker-new-db                      Delete your database and create a new one with fake data
  docker-new-env                     Get a new dev environment and a new database with fake data
  docker-npm                         Shorthand to npm. inv docker.npm "[COMMAND] [ARG]"
  docker-pipenv                      Shorthand to pipenv. inv docker.pipenv "[COMMAND] [ARG]"
  docker-test-node                   Run node tests
  docker-test-python                 Run python tests
```

`docker-` prefixes all Docker commands. Note the double quotes to pass multiples arguments to `docker-manage`, `docker-pipenv` and `docker-npm` commands. There's no `invoke docker-runserver` command: use `docker-compose up` instead.

**A few examples:** `invoke docker-pipenv "install requests""`: add requests to your `Pipfile` and lock it. :rotating_light: The package won't be installed: you need to [rebuild your image](./local_development_with_docker.md#python).
- `invoke docker-manage load_fake_data`: add more fake data to your project,
- `invoke docker-npm "install moment"`: install moment, add it to your `package.json` and lock it.

### Docker and docker-compose CLIs

We strongly recommend you to check at least the [docker-compose CLI](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) documentation since we're using it a lot. Meanwhile, here are the commands you will use the most:

**docker-compose:**
- [docker-compose up](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/): start the services and the project. Stop them with `^C`. If you want to rebuild your images, for example after a python dependencies update, add the `--build` flag. If you want to run the services in detached mode, use `--detached`. To get logs, use `docker-compose logs --follow [SERVICE]`,
- [docker-compose down](): stop and remove the services,
- [docker-compose run (--rm) [SERVICE NAME] [COMMAND]](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/run/): run a command against a service. `--rm` removes your container when you're done,
- [docker-compose build [SERVICE NAME]](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/build/): build a new image for the service. Use `--no-cache` to build the image from scratch again,
- [docker-compose ps](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/ps/): list the services running.

**docker:**
- [docker image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image/): interact with images,
- [docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container/): interact with containers,
- [docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/): interact with volumes.
- [docker system prune](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/): delete all unused container, image and network. Add `--volumes` to also remove volume. :rotating_light: It will impact other docker project running on your system! For a more subtle approach, [check this blog post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes) on to remove elements selectively.

### How to install or update dependencies?

The significant difference between the two is that python dependencies are "baked" into the image, while JS dependencies are stored in a volume.

#### Python

**Install packages:**

Use `invoke docker-pipenv "install [PACKAGE]"`.

:rotating_light: Important note! :rotating_light: This **only** add the dependency to your `Pipfile` and lock-it: it doesn't install your dependency! After running this command, run `docker-compose build backend` to create a new and updated backend image to use.

**Update packages:**

To update your dependencies, do `invoke docker-pipenv update`, then build the new image with `docker-compose build backend`.

#### JS

**Install packages:**

Use `invoke docker-npm "install [PACKAGE]"`.

**Update packages:**

Use `invoke docker-npm update`.

You don't need to rebuild the `watch-static-files` image.

## Connecting Docker to your code editor


### Pycharm

This feature is only available for the professional version of Pycharm. Follow the official instructions [available here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docker-as-a-remote-interpreter.html#config-docker)

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code use a feature called Dev Container to run Docker projects. The configuration files are in the `.devconatainer` directory. This feature is only available starting VSCode 1.35 stable. For now, we're only creating a python container to get Intellisense, we're not running the full project inside VSCode. We may revisit this in the future if Docker support in VSCode improves.

A few things to keep in mind when using that setup:
- Do not use the terminal in VSCode when running `invoke docker-` commands: use a local terminal instead,
- when running `inv docker-catchup` or installing python dependencies, you will need to rebuild the Dev Container. To do that, press `F1` and look for `Rebuild Container`.

#### Instructions:

- Install the [Remote - containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers),
- Open the project in VSCode: it detects the Dev Container files and a popup appears: click on `Reopen in a Container`,
- Wait for the Dev Container to build,
- Work as usual and use the docker invoke commands in a terminal outside VSCode.

## Docker vocabulary and overview

Welcome to Docker! Before jumping into Docker installation, take a moment to get familiar with Docker vocabulary:

- Docker: Docker is a platform to develop, deploy and run applications with containers.
- Docker engine: The Docker engine is a service running in the background (daemon). It's managing containers.
- Docker CLI: Command Line Interface to interact with Docker. For example, `Docker image ls` lists the images available on your system.
- Docker hub: Registry containing Docker images.
- Image: An image is a file used to build containers: In our case, it's mostly instructions to install dependencies.
- Container: Containers run an image. In our case, we have a container for the database, another one for building static files and the last one for running Django. A container life is ephemeral: data written there don't persist when you shut down a container.
- Volume: A volume is a special directory on your machine that is used to make data persistent. For example, we use it to store the database: that way, you don't lose your data when you turn down your containers.
- Host: host is used in Docker docs to mean the system on top of which containers run.
- Docker-compose: It's a tool to run multi-container applications: we use it to run our three containers together.
- Docker-compose CLI: Command line interface to interact with docker-compose. It's used to launch your dev environment.
- Docker-compose service: a service is a container and the configuration associated to it.

I would recommend watching [An Intro to Docker for Djangonauts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsEfVSTZO9Q) by Lacey Williams Henschel (25 min, [repo mentioned in the talk](https://github.com/williln/docker-hogwarts)): it's a great beginner talk to learn Docker and how to use it with Django.

### Project Structure

All our containers run on Linux.

For local development, we have two Dockerfiles that define our images:
- `Dockerfile.node`: use a node8 Debian Stretch slim base image from the Docker Hub and install node dependencies,
- `Dockerfile.python`: use a python3.7 Debian Stretch slim base image, install required build dependencies before installing pipenv and the project dependencies.
We don't have a custom image for running postgres and use one from the Docker Hub.

The `docker-compose.yml` file describes the 3 services that the project needs to run:
- `watch-static-files`: rebuilds static files when they're modified,
- `postgres`: contains a postgres database,
- `backend`: runs Django. Starting this one automatically starts the two other ones.

### Resources about Docker

## FAQ

### Do I need to build the static files before doing a `docker-compose up`?

Static files are automatically built when starting the `watch-static-files` container.

### Where is Docker fitting in all the tools we're already using?

Let's do a quick overview of all the tools you're currently using to run the foundation site on your computer:

- `npm`: use to manage javascript dependencies (`packages.json`, `packages-lock.json`). Also used to launch commands like `npm run start`.
- `pipenv`: use to manage python dependencies (`pipfile`, `pipfile.lock`). Also manage a python virtual environment, which isolates the foundation site's python packages from the rest of your system.
- `invoke`/`inv`: use as a cli tool to provide shortcuts for most used commands. ex: `inv runserver` is a shortcut for `pipenv run python network-api/manage.py runserver`.

We still use all those tools with Docker. The major difference is that `npm` and `pipenv` is now running inside a container, while invoke continues to run as before.

### Can I use Docker in parallel with the old way of running the foundation site?

Short answer is yes but:
- you will have two different databases.
- those two environment won't share their dependencies: you will have to maintain and update both of them.
