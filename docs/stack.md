## Stack

### HTML

HTML for the majority of the site is generated from Django/Wagtail templates and components.

### CSS

CSS is generated from [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). The [Mofo Bootstrap](https://github.com/mozilla/mofo-bootstrap) theme is pulled in by default.

### React

React is used *à la carte* for isolated component instances (eg: a tab switcher) since this is not a single page application, but rather a static generated website. This precludes the need for Flux architecture, or such libraries as React Router.

To add a React component, you can target a container element from `/source/js/main.js` and inject it.

### Django and Wagtail

Django powers the backend of the site, and we use Wagtail with Django to provide CMS features and functionality.

#### localization

We use [wagtail-modeltranslations](https://github.com/infoportugal/wagtail-modeltranslation) for CMS content localization. Please see its documentation for more information.

#### A/B testing

We use [wagtail-experiments](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail-experiments) for CMS-based A/B testing. Please see its documentation for more information.

### S3 and Cloudinary

Most assets are stored on S3. Buyers Guide images are hosted on Cloudinary.
