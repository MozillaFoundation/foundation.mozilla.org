## Stack

### HTML

HTML for the majority of the site is generated from Django/Wagtail templates and components.

### Frontend styleguide

This site has a [styleguide](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/style-guide/), which can be refrenced for frontend development to note intended usage of exisitng styles and components.

### CSS

CSS is generated from [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Styles are based on the mofo-bootstrap theme found under `source/sass/mofo-bootstrap`.

### React

React is used _à la carte_ for isolated component instances (eg: a tab switcher) since the site is not designed as a single page application. This precludes the need for Flux architecture, or such libraries as React Router.

To add a React component, you can target a container element from `/source/js/main.js` and inject it.

### Django and Wagtail

Django powers the backend of the site, and we use Wagtail with Django to provide CMS features and functionality.

If you are defining a new page class for the site, make sure it inherits both the Wagtail `Page` class as well as the `FoundationMetadataPageMixin` mixin. The first is a general Wagtail requirement, and the latter ensures that page metadata used for SEO and the like is (generally) correct.

#### localization

We use [wagtail-modeltranslations](https://github.com/infoportugal/wagtail-modeltranslation) for CMS content localization. Please see its documentation for more information.

#### A/B testing

We use [wagtail-experiments](https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail-experiments) for CMS-based A/B testing. Please see its documentation for more information.

### S3 and Cloudinary
