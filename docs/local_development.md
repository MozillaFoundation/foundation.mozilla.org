# Local Dev Documentation

This documentation is composed of three main sections:

- [How to install and use Docker for local development](./local_development.md#how-to-use)
- [Connecting Docker to your code editor](./local_development.md#connecting-docker-to-your-code-editor)
- [Docker 101 and how we use it with the foundation site](./local_development.md#docker-vocabulary-and-overview). Start here if you're new to Docker
- [FAQ](./local_development.md#faq)

## How to use

To interact with the project, you can use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) CLIs or use shortcuts with invoke.

The general workflow is:

- Install the project with `invoke new-env`,
- Run the project with `docker-compose up`,
- Log into the admin site with username `admin` and password `admin`,
- Use invoke commands for frequent development tasks (database migrations, dependencies install, run tests, etc),
- After doing a `git pull`, keep your clone up to date by running `invoke catchup`.

### Invoke commands

To get a list of invoke commands available, run `invoke -l`:

```
  catch-up (catchup, docker-catchup)           Rebuild images, install dependencies, and apply migrations
  compilemessages (docker-compilemessages)     Compile the latest translations
  l10n-sync (docker-l10n-sync)                 Sync localizable fields in the database
  l10n-update (docker-l10n-update)             Update localizable field data (copies from original unlocalized to
                                               default localized field)
  makemessages (docker-makemessages)           Extract all template messages in .po files for localization
  makemigrations (docker-makemigrations)       Creates new migration(s) for apps
  manage (docker-manage)                       Shorthand to manage.py. inv docker-manage "[COMMAND] [ARG]"
  migrate (docker-migrate)                     Updates database schema
  new-db (docker-new-db)                       Delete your database and create a new one with fake data
  new-env (docker-new-env)                     Get a new dev environment and a new database with fake data
  npm (docker-npm)                             Shorthand to npm. inv docker-npm "[COMMAND] [ARG]"
  npm-install (docker-npm-install)             Install Node dependencies
  pip-compile (docker-pip-compile)             Shorthand to pip-tools. inv pip-compile "[COMMAND] [ARG]"
  pip-compile-lock (docker-pip-compile-lock)   Lock prod and dev dependencies
  pip-sync (docker-pip-sync)                   Sync your python virtualenv
  test (docker-test)                           Run both Node and Python tests
  test-node (docker-test-node)                 Run node tests
  test-python (docker-test-python)             Run python tests
```

Note the above commands carefully, as they should cover the majority of what you'd need for local development.

For instance, you can run also run common Django commands via invoke, such as `inv manage "makemigrations --merge"` or `inv manage shell`.

**A few examples:**

- `invoke manage load_fake_data`: add more fake data to your project,
- `invoke npm "install moment"`: install moment, add it to your `package.json` and lock it.

### Docker and docker-compose CLIs

We strongly recommend you to check at least the [docker-compose CLI](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) documentation since we're using it a lot. Meanwhile, here are the commands you will use the most:

**docker-compose:**

- [docker-compose up](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/): start the services and the project. Stop them with `^C`. If you want to rebuild your images, for example after a python dependencies update, add the `--build` flag. If you want to run the services in detached mode, use `--detached`. To get logs, use `docker-compose logs --follow [SERVICE]`,
- [docker-compose down](): stop and remove the services,
- [docker-compose run (--rm) [SERVICE NAME] [COMMAND]](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/run/): run a command against a service. `--rm` removes your container when you're done,
- [docker-compose build [SERVICE NAME]](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/build/): build a new image for the service. Use `--no-cache` to build the image from scratch again,
- [docker-compose ps](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/ps/): list the services running.

**docker:**

- [docker image](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/image/): interact with images,
- [docker container](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container/): interact with containers,
- [docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/): interact with volumes.
- [docker system prune](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/): delete all unused container, image and network. Add `--volumes` to also remove volume. :rotating_light: It will impact other docker project running on your system! For a more subtle approach, [check this blog post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes) on to remove elements selectively.

### How to install or update dependencies?

#### Python

**Note on [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)**:

- Only edit the `.in` files and use `invoke pip-compile-lock` to generate `.txt` files.
- Both `(dev-)requirements.txt` and `(dev-)requirements.in` files need to be pushed to Github.
- `.txt` files act as lockfiles, where dependencies are pinned to a precise version.

Dependencies live on your filesystem: you don't need to rebuild the `backend` image when installing or updating dependencies.

**Install packages:**

- Modify the `requirements.in` or `dev-requirements.in` to add the dependency you want to install.
- Run `invoke pip-compile-lock`.
- Run `invoke pip-sync`.

**Update packages:**

- `invoke pip-compile "-upgrade (dev-)requirements.in"`: update all (the dev) dependencies.
- `invoke pip-compile "--upgrade-package [PACKAGE](==x.x.x)"`: update the specified dependency. To update multiple dependencies, you always need to add the `-P` flag.

When it's done, run `inv pip-sync`.

#### JS

Dependencies live on your filesystem: you don't need to rebuild the `watch-static-files` image when installing or updating dependencies.

**Install packages:**

Use `invoke npm "install [PACKAGE]"`.

**Update packages:**

Use `invoke npm update`.

### Using a copy of the staging database for critical testing

Requirements:

- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- Heroku Account with membership on the Mozilla team (ask in #mofo-engineering on Slack)

Some development work requires testing changes against "whatever the current production database looks like", which requires having postgresql installed locally (`brew install postgresql` on mac; download and run the official installer for windows; if you use linux/unix, you know how to install things for your favourite flavour, so just do that for postgresql). We backport prod data to staging every week, scrubbing PII, so we'll be creating a copy of that for local testing, too.

**Note**: your postgres version must be compatible with the version that is used on heroku in order for the `pg_dump` command to work. In general, this means that the result of `psql --version` must be **greater or equal to** the version found when running `heroku pg:info -a foundation-mofostaging-net` (look for "PG Version")

The steps involved in cloning the database for local use are as follows:

1. Run `docker-compose up postgres` to start the `postgres` service without starting the rest of the server setup (note that if you want to detach stdout, add the `-d` flag to the command)
2. Drop the existing `wagtail` database in the PostgreSQL server inside your docker environment with `dropdb --if-exists -h localhost -p 5678 -U foundation wagtail`
3. Use the Heroku CLI to pull the remote database into your local docker PostgreSQL server with `heroku pg:pull -a foundation-mofostaging-net DATABASE_URL postgresql://foundation@localhost:5678/wagtail`

If you need to reset this database, running through these steps again will get you back into sync with staging.

## Connecting Docker to your code editor

### Pycharm

This feature is only available for the professional version of Pycharm. Follow the official instructions [available here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-docker-as-a-remote-interpreter.html#config-docker)

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code uses a feature called Dev Container to run Docker projects. The configuration files are in the `.devconatainer` directory. This feature is only available starting VSCode 1.35 stable. For now, we're only creating a python container to get Intellisense, we're not running the full project inside VSCode. We may revisit this in the future if Docker support in VSCode improves.

A few things to keep in mind when using that setup:

- Do not use the terminal in VSCode when running `invoke docker-` commands: use a local terminal instead,
- when running `inv docker-catchup` or installing python dependencies, you will need to rebuild the Dev Container. To do that, press `F1` and look for `Rebuild Container`.

#### Instructions:

- Install the [Remote - containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers),
- Open the project in VSCode: it detects the Dev Container files and a popup appears: click on `Reopen in a Container`,
- Wait for the Dev Container to build,
- Work as usual and use the docker invoke commands in a terminal outside VSCode.

#### Debugging

Ensure you have the official [python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) for Visual Studio Code installed. It provides the debugging type required for the run configuration to work.

1. Set the `VSCODE_DEBUGGER` value to `True` in your .env

2. Rebuild your Docker containers: `inv docker-catchup`, then `docker-compose up`

3. Start the debug session from VS Code for the `[django:docker] runserver` configuration

   1. Open up the debugger, or open the Command Palette and select
      `View: Show Run and Debug`.

   2. Select `[django:docker] runserver` from the dropdown near the Play button in the top left.

   3. Hit the Play button or hit `F5` to start debugging

      - Logs will redirect to your integrated terminal as well.

4. Set some breakpoints!

   - You can create a breakpoint by clicking to the left of a line number. When that code is
     executed, the debugger will pause code execution so you can inspect the call stack and
     variables. You can either resume code execution or manage code execution manually by stepping
     into the next pieces of code, or over them.

## Docker vocabulary and overview

Welcome to Docker! Before jumping into Docker installation, take a moment to get familiar with Docker vocabulary:

- Docker: Docker is a platform to develop, deploy and run applications with containers.
- Docker engine: The Docker engine is a service running in the background (daemon). It's managing containers.
- Docker CLI: Command Line Interface to interact with Docker. For example, `Docker image ls` lists the images available on your system.
- Docker hub: Registry containing Docker images.
- Image: An image is a file used to build containers: In our case, it's mostly instructions to install dependencies.
- Container: Containers run an image. In our case, we have a container for the database, another one for building static files and the last one for running Django. A container life is ephemeral: data written there don't persist when you shut down a container.
- Volume: A volume is a special directory on your machine that is used to make data persistent. For example, we use it to store the database: that way, you don't lose your data when you turn down your containers.
- Host: host is used in Docker docs to mean the system on top of which containers run.
- Docker-compose: It's a tool to run multi-container applications: we use it to run our three containers together.
- Docker-compose CLI: Command line interface to interact with docker-compose. It's used to launch your dev environment.
- Docker-compose service: a service is a container and the configuration associated to it.

I would recommend watching [An Intro to Docker for Djangonauts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsEfVSTZO9Q) by Lacey Williams Henschel (25 min, [repo mentioned in the talk](https://github.com/williln/docker-hogwarts)): it's a great beginner talk to learn Docker and how to use it with Django.

### Project Structure

All our containers run on Linux.

For local development, we have two Dockerfiles that define our images:

- `Dockerfile.node`: use a node8 Debian Stretch slim base image from the Docker Hub and install node dependencies,
- `Dockerfile.python`: use a python3.7 Debian Stretch slim base image, install required build dependencies before installing pipenv and the project dependencies.
  We don't have a custom image for running postgres and use one from the Docker Hub.

The `docker-compose.yml` file describes the 3 services that the project needs to run:

- `watch-static-files`: rebuilds static files when they're modified,
- `postgres`: contains a postgres database,
- `backend`: runs Django. Starting this one automatically starts the two other ones.

### Resources about Docker

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) documentations,
- [Intro to Docker](https://www.revsys.com/tidbits/brief-intro-docker-djangonauts/): Lacey wrote a good intro tutorial to Docker and Django, without Harry Potter metaphors this time :),
- [Jérôme Petazzoni's training slides and talks](https://container.training/): presentations and slides if you want to dive into Docker.

#### Useful commands using Django with Docker

To open a terminal session inside the docker container (`docker container ls` to see active docker container ids):
`docker exec it {docker-container-id} bash`
Activate the python environment:
`source dockerpythonvenv/bin/activate`

Then you can do Django stuff like:
`cd network-api/ && python manage.py makemigrations --merge`
or run Django shell, etc.

## FAQ

### Do I need to build the static files before doing a `docker-compose up`?

Static files are automatically built when starting the `watch-static-files` container.

### Where is Docker fitting in all the tools we're already using?

Let's do a quick overview of all the tools you're currently using to run the foundation site on your computer:

- `npm`: use to manage javascript dependencies (`packages.json`, `packages-lock.json`). Also used to launch commands like `npm run start`.
- `pip-tools`: use to manage python dependencies (`(dev-)requirements.in` and `(dev-)requirements.txt`).
- `invoke`/`inv`: use as a cli tool to provide shortcuts for most used commands. ex: `inv migrate` is a shortcut for `docker-compose run --rm backend ./dockerpythonvenv/bin/python network-api/manage.py migrate`.

We still use all those tools with Docker. The major difference is that `npm` and `python` are now running inside a container, while invoke continues to run outside of it.

### Can I use Docker in parallel with the old way of running the foundation site?

Short answer is yes, but those two environments won't share their dependencies: you will have to maintain and update both of them.
