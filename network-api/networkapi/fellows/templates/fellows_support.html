          <h3 class="h3-heading mb-3">Host a fellow</h3>
          <p>Organizations defending an open and accessible web are the backbone of our fellowship program. They socialize fellows to a global assortment of issues, policies, and technologies, and inspire them with meaningful work that impacts the health of the internet.</p>
          <p>In the past five years, the fellowship has partnered with dozens of host organizations around the globe and across sectors, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Derechos Digitales, European Digital Rights, Freedom of the Press Foundation, and many more. Host organizations are united by a shared goal of a healthy internet.</p>
          <p>This year, we are particularly interested in partnering with host organizations whose missions or projects align with Mozilla’s latest impact goal: “<a href="https://medium.com/read-write-participate/slowing-down-asking-questions-looking-ahead-265f6b99810d">better machine decision making</a>,” or ensuring artificial intelligence is developed with ethics, responsibility, and accountability in mind. More broadly, host organizations should be working on initiatives related to online privacy or security; openness; decentralization, digital inclusion; and/or web literacy.</p>
