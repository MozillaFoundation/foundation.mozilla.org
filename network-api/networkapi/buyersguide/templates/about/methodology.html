      The goal of Mozilla’s <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> buyer’s guide is to help consumers shop smart — and safe — for
      products that connect to the Internet. Many companies don’t provide clear information about the privacy and
      security of the connected devices they sell. Is your personal data being used in ways you may not have
      anticipated or expected? What are the risks of buying a product that collects your health data? How does the
      company regularly test for and fix security vulnerabilities?
      {% endblocktrans %}

    <p class="body">
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      It’s difficult for consumers to get clear, concrete information from companies about the security and privacy of
      their connected products. With this guide, we hoped to help consumers navigate this landscape by understanding
      what questions they should ask before buying a device.

        There are 76 products in the 2019 version of our <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> buyer’s guide. These products
        fit into six categories — Toys & Games, Smart Home, Entertainment, Wearables, Health & Exercise, and Pets.

      Mozilla has established a set of <a href="{{sec_standards}}">Minimum Security Standards</a> it has determined should be met by any manufacturer developing connected devices. We evaluated each product on our list against five criteria:
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>

    <section aria-labelledby="encryption">
      <p id="encryption"><b>{% trans "Encryption" %}</b></p>
      <p class="body">
        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Device should use encryption in transit and at rest (where applicable). The product must use encryption for all
        of its network communications functions and capabilities, ensuring that communications aren’t eavesdropped or
        modified in transit. User data should be encrypted when it is stored.
        {% endblocktrans %}

    <section aria-labelledby="security-updates">
      <p id="security-updates"><b>{% trans "Security updates" %}</b></p>
      <p class="body">
        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        The product must support automatic security updates for a reasonable period after sale, and be enabled by
        default. This ensures that when a vulnerability is known, the vendor can make security updates available for
        consumers, which are verified (using some form of cryptography) and then installed seamlessly.
        {% endblocktrans %}

      <p id="strong-passwords"><b>{% trans "Strong passwords" %}</b></p>
      <p class="body">
        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        If the product uses passwords for remote authentication, it must require that strong passwords are used,
        including having password strength requirements. Any non-unique default passwords must also be reset as part of
        the device’s initial setup. This helps protect the device from vulnerability to guessable password attacks,
        which could result in a compromised device.

      <p class="body">
        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        The vendor must have a system in place to manage vulnerabilities in the product. This must also include a point
        of contact for reporting vulnerabilities or a bug bounty program. This ensures that vendors are actively managing
        vulnerabilities throughout the product’s lifecycle.

      We evaluated the privacy documentation — which included privacy policies, privacy pages, FAQs – for each company
      selling these products to determine (1) how data is shared with third parties, (2) whether or not users could
      request deletion of their data, and (3) the accessibility/readability of the privacy information. Where relevant,
      we also looked at whether (4) biometric data is collected, and (5) parental controls are in place.

        How do companies collect and share customer data with third parties? For this question, we analyzed the privacy

        than standard vendors.
        {% endblocktrans %}

        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        For instance, if a company can share or sell personal customer data with third parties, use  data for targeted
        advertising, or if third parties can use data for commercial purposes, then we noted this. We also noted where
        the company is permitted to sell or share aggregated, de-identified data. Even if the data is not personally
        identifiable, consumers have a right to know how their information may be used.

        Does the company provide a way for users to request deletion of their data? We looked for language around this

        How easy is it to find clear information about a device’s privacy? How clearly is that information stated?
        Privacy information should be clear, readable, and communicate basic information to consumers about what happens

        privacy policy or in another privacy page.

        Biometric data is data that describes our bodies and distinctive personal characteristics. Many devices collect
        sensitive data about our heart rate, our sleep patterns, and our menstrual cycle, for instance. Some even use
        data about our face and voice to identify us. We noted which products collect biometric data.

        For you to set up your new device, you will probably need to download an app. Both of these (the device and the
        app) will most likely need data to make things work. The app will typically need to request permissions for it

        <a href="{{url}}">Google Play store for Android</a> to check on the permissions requested by each app.

        with most of the products in this guide. However, it’s also good to think through what <em>could</em> happen if
        something goes wrong. This question looks a potential worst-case scenarios for each product, in some cases for
        fun and in some cases based on things that have already happened with the product.
