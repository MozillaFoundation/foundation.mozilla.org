      The goal of Mozilla’s <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> buyer’s guide is to help consumers
      shop smart—and safe—for products that connect to the Internet. Many companies don’t
      provide clear information about the privacy and security of the connected devices they sell.
      Is your personal data being used in ways you may not have anticipated or expected? What
      are the risks of buying a product that collects your health data? How does the company
      regularly test for and fix security vulnerabilities?

    <p class="body">

      It’s difficult for consumers to get clear, concrete information from companies about the
      security and privacy of their connected products. With this guide, we hoped to help
      consumers navigate this landscape by understanding what questions they should ask before
      buying a device.

        of not protecting privacy, or if we could not confirm if they met our

        something goes wrong. This question looks at potential worst-case scenarios for
        each product, in some cases for fun, and in some cases, based on things that
        have already happened with the product.

        A product should use encryption in transit and at rest (where applicable). The product

        The product must support automatic security updates for a reasonable period after sale,
