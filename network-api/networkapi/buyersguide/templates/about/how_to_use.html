      {% blocktrans with url="https://foundation.mozilla.org/privacynotincluded/about/meets-minimum-security-standards" trimmed %}
      We developed a set of minimum security standards we think all connected products should meet at the <em>very</em>
      least. Think of it as a “you must be this tall to ride” set of standards. These include five basic things: The
      product must use encryption, the company must provide automatic security updates, if a product uses a password,
      it must require a strong password, the company must have a way to manage security vulnerabilities found in their
      products, and the company must have an accessible privacy policy. If you would like to learn more about our
      minimum security standards, <a href="{{url}}">go here</a>.

      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Encryption is your friend. It protects your private and personal information by scrambling it up into a code so
      that the only people or machines who can read it are the ones on the other end who have the key to unscramble that
      code. Products that don’t use encryption send personal information over the internet unscrambled so anyone can see
      it.

    <p id="security-updates"><b>{% trans "Security updates" %}</b></p>
    <p class="body">
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Sometimes security vulnerabilities are found in products after they are sold to the public. For that reason,
      companies should have a way to quickly push a security update out to the product automatically so it fixes the
      security vulnerability without the consumer ever needing to worry about it.

      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Remembering passwords might be annoying, but having a good password is still one of the best lines of defense we
      have when it comes to protecting our privacy and security. It’s great when a password is required. But default
      passwords that are the same for all consumers and never change can be just as bad. You should be required to change
      the default password to a strong password. Products with a default password that does not require changing can
      leave users’ personal information exposed.

      Security vulnerabilities in products happen. It’s how companies manage them when they arise that matter. We looked
      at
      whether or not companies have a system in place to manage vulnerabilities in the product when they are found. This
      includes having a point of contact for reporting vulnerabilities or an equivalent <a href="{{url}}">bug

      Just because a device has a camera, microphone, or tracks location doesn’t mean it will snoop on you. It simply
      means it <em>could</em> and you should be aware of that. Also, many connected devices are controlled by apps on
      your phone.
      The apps often ask to use the phone’s camera, microphone or location tracking. Keep an eye on that, as some of the
      permissions the apps ask for might surprise you.

      Security and privacy are two separate concerns when it comes to connected products. A company can take measures to
      make a device secure, while also being questionable on how it handles the data that device might collect on you.
      Consumers should ask questions like what data does the device collect, how does the company use that data, who does
      it share that data with, and can you delete the data they collect?

      Nearly every company collects some kind of information on its users. That’s how the internet works. It’s how they
      use and care for this information that matters. You should know whether a company shares or sells your personal

      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Privacy information should be clear, readable, and communicate basic information to consumers about what happens to
      their data. Privacy policies are often written more for lawyers than consumers. That’s why it’s nice to see more
      and more companies creating consumer-friendly privacy pages to outline how they handle your personal information
      and the data they collected on their users. We hope to see this trend continue.

      Mozilla Foundation does not receive any money from the companies featured in this guide or from linking to sites
      where users purchase products. We are currently experimenting with Web Monetization on a small number of our

      directly, outside of the dominant advertising model. Only users with a Web Monetization enabled extension in their
      browsers will be aware of the implementation. Read more about our Web Monetization experiment <a{{link_args}}>here</a>.
