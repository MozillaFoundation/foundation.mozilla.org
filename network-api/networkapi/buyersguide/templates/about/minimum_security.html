      Despite growing concerns about the safety and security of internet-connected devices, many companies still build
      and sell connected products that are insecure. Take the <a href="{{npr}}">FREDI wireless baby camera monitor</a>,
      for instance, which has been repeatedly hacked. Further, many companies don’t provide clear information about the
      data privacy of the devices they sell. Is your personal data being used in ways you may not have anticipated or
      expected?

      In 2018, <a href="{{mozilla}}">Mozilla</a>, <a href="{{ci}}">Consumers International</a>, and the
      <a href="{{isoc}}">Internet Society</a>, decided to take a more proactive approach to these gaps. We believe that
      industry should start talking about what some of the initial ‘red lines’ are in this space, and should phase out
      practices that lead to the most egregious failings in connected devices.

        The product must use encryption for all of its network communications functions and capabilities. This ensures
        that all communications are not eavesdropped or modified in transit. The product must also use encryption at
        rest to ensure that customer data is protected in storage.

        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        The product must support automatic updates for a reasonable period after sale, and be enabled by default. This
        ensures that when a vulnerability is known, the vendor can make security updates available for consumers, which
        are verified and then installed seamlessly. Updates must not make the product unavailable for an extended period.

        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        If the product uses passwords for remote authentication, it must require that strong passwords are used,
        including having password strength requirements. Any non-unique default passwords must also be reset as part of
        the device’s initial setup. This helps protect the device from vulnerability to guessable password attacks,
        which could result in a compromised device.

        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        The vendor must have a system in place to manage vulnerabilities in the product. This must also include a point
        of contact for reporting vulnerabilities or an equivalent bug bounty program. This ensures that vendors are
        actively managing vulnerabilities throughout the product’s lifecycle.
