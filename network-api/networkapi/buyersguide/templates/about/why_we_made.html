      Welcome to the fourth edition of<a {{link_args}}>Mozilla’s</a> <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> buyer’s
      guide. Our goal is to help you shop smart—and safe—for products that connect to the internet.

      In 2017, when we first started <em>*Privacy Not Included</em>, we didn’t know if people would be
      interested in a guide about the privacy and security of connected toys, gadgets, and smart home
      products. Turns out, they were. And it wasn’t just people who were interested. We discovered
      companies were too. We’re happy to see both consumers and companies increasingly value connected
      products that are safe, secure, and private.

      We’re very excited our <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> buyer’s guide now comes with
      <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> warning labels on products we think consumers should think twice
      about before buying. It’s no small thing to assign such a label to a product, so we set
      ourselves some strict standards. If we can’t confirm a product meets our Minimum Security Standards
       it automatically earns the label. We also factor in if a product shares or sells your data,
       doesn’t let you delete your data, or if the company has a poor track record of protecting their
       users’ data into our decision to assign these warning labels. We hope users will find these
       warnings useful. We also include a Best Of category now to showcase companies who are doing
       privacy and security right.

      We realize people want to just know which products are safe and which aren’t. We are Mozilla—not a
      consumer product review company—so we won’t say “Buy this, don’t buy that.” Instead, we used our
      technical expertise to create a set of <a href="{{url}}">Minimum Security Standards</a> we think all
      products should meet in order to be sold in stores. Those standards include using encryption,
      automatic security updates, requiring strong passwords, having a system to manage vulnerabilities,
      and having an accessible privacy policy.

      We want users of this guide to be able to share their opinion too. It’s important companies, and
      other consumers, see which products people think are safe, and which products people feel are a
      bit creepy. So we created our Creep-O-Meter—a user rating on each product—to let folks give their
      opinion. Companies are paying attention, so let them know if you think their product is creepy or not.

      Our product list has grown to 136 connected products across seven categories. You’ll notice a
      lot of research went into this guide. From knowing if the device uses a camera or microphone,
      or tracks your location or biometric data, to our section laying out what could happen if
      something goes wrong with a product--we’ve covered a lot of ground. Fortunately, we have great
      researchers and expertise here at Mozilla to dig into this so you don’t have to.  Our
      researchers combed through privacy policies, reached out to companies with questions about
      encryption and bug bounty programs, and sifted through product and app specifications. We’ve
      done our best to make your access to all this research easy to understand.

      We hope you use and enjoy this guide to help you think about, shop for, and buy products from
      companies that show they value privacy and security. We as consumers need to demand that value
      from the people who build our products. It’s how we’ll start to make the internet, and our
      lives, a bit safer in this digital world. That is our goal every day here at Mozilla.
