      Welcome to the third edition of <a{{link_args}}>Mozilla’s</a> <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> buyer’s guide. Our
      goal is to help you shop smart—and safe—for products that connect to the internet.

      Three years ago when we first started <em>*Privacy Not Included</em>, we didn’t know if people would be interested
      in a guide about the privacy and security of connected toys, gadgets, and smart home products. Turns out, they
      were. And it wasn’t just people who were interested. We discovered companies were too. We’re happy to see both
      consumers and companies increasingly value connected products that are safe, secure, and private.

      We realize people want to <em>just know</em> which products are safe and which aren’t. We are Mozilla—not a
      consumer product review company—so we won’t say “Buy this, don’t buy that.” Instead, we used our technical
      expertise to create a set of <a href={{url}}>Minimum Security Standards</a> we think all products should meet in
      order to be sold in stores. Those standards include using encryption, automatic security updates, requiring strong
      passwords, having a system to manage vulnerabilities, and having an accessible privacy policy. Look for the “Meets
      Our Minimum Security Standards” badge on products in the guide. This year we’ve also added a star rating near the
      top of each product page so you can glance at a product and see just how well it does on our Minimum Security
      Standards.

      We want users of this guide to be able to share their opinion too. It’s important that companies, and other
      consumers, see which products people think are safe, and which products people feel are a bit creepy. So we
      created our Creep-O-Meter—a user rating on each product—to let folks give their opinion. Companies are paying
      attention, so let them know if you think their product is creepy or not and if you’re likely to buy it.

      Our product list has grown to 76 connected products across six categories. You’ll notice a lot of research went
      into this guide. From knowing if the device uses a camera or microphone, or tracks your location or biometric data,
      to our section laying out what could happen if something goes wrong with a product—we’ve covered a lot of ground.
      Fortunately, we have great researchers and expertise here at Mozilla to dig into this so you don’t have to. Our
      researchers combed through privacy policies, reached out to companies with questions about encryption and bug
      bounty programs, and sifted through product and app specifications. We’ve done our best to make your access to all
      this research easy to understand.

      We hope you use and enjoy this guide to help you think about, shop for, and buy products from companies that show
      they value privacy and security. If you want to dig deeper, our friends on Mozilla’s Internet Health Report team
      have created a companion to our buyer’s guide that explains what can be done to make things better. It’s called
      <a{{link_args}}>*Privacy Included: Rethinking the Smart Home</a>.

      We as consumers need to demand that value from the people who build our products. It’s how we’ll start to make the
      internet, and our lives, a bit safer in this digital world. That is our goal every day here at Mozilla.
