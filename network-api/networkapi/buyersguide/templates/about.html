        How to Use This Guide
      </h1>

      <p>
        Need help understanding how to use this guide? Here you go:
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Creep-O-Meter
      </h2>
      <p>
        Our new Creep-O-Meter is for you to share your opinion. Read the review of the product, then rate how creepy or
        not creepy you think the product is and how likely you are to buy it. Click vote to see how your opinion stacks
        up to others.

      <h2 class="normal">
        Our Minimum Security Standards
      </h2>
      <p>
        We developed a set of minimum security standards we think all connected products should meet at the very least.
        Think of it as a “you must be this tall to ride” set of standards. These include five basic things: The product
        must use encryption, the company must provide automatic security updates, if a product uses a password, it must
        require a strong password, the company must have a way to manage security vulnerabilities found in their
        products, and the company must have an accessible privacy policy. If you would like to learn more about our
        minimum security standards go <a href="https://medium.com/read-write-participate/minimum-standards-for-tackling-iot-security-70f90b37f2d5">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Can it spy on me?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Just because a device has a camera, microphone, or tracks location doesn’t mean it will spy on you. It simply
        means it could and you should be aware of that. Also, many connected devices are controlled by apps on your
        phone. The apps often ask to use the phone’s camera, microphone or location tracking. Keep an eye on that, as
        some of the permissions the apps ask for might surprise you.
      </p>
      <h2 class="normal">
        Encryption
      </h2>
      <p>
        Encryption is your friend. It protects your private and personal information by scrambling it up into a code so
        that the only people or machines who can read it are the ones on the other end who have the key to unscramble
        that code. Products that don’t use encryption send personal information over the internet unscrambled so anyone
        can see it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Privacy policies
      </h2>
      <p>
        Privacy policies detail a lot of important information about how companies collect, use, and share your
        personal information. Because of that, this information should be easily found and easily understood. You’ll
        notice we included reading levels of all the privacy policies in this guide thanks to the <a href="https://explore.usableprivacy.org/"> Usable
        Privacy Policy Project</a>. Some have middle school reading levels and some have college reading levels.
        Needing a college degree to understand how a company plans to use your personal information is not ideal.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Shares information with third parties for unexpected reasons
      </h2>
      <p>
        Nearly every company collects some kind of information on its users. That’s how the internet works. It’s how they use and care for this information that matters. You should know whether a company shares or sells your personal information to others and for what reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the purpose of this report Mozilla determined that if according to a company’s privacy policy, it appeared to share data with third parties that could then use that information to market or advertise to customers, then we labeled it as “Shares information with third parties for unexpected reasons.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Change Default Password
      </h2>
      <p>
        Remembering passwords might be annoying, but having a good password is still one of the best lines of defense
        we have when it comes to protecting our privacy and security. It’s great when a password is required. But
        default passwords that are the same for all consumers and never change can be just as bad. You should be
        required to change a default password. Products with a default password that does not require changing can
        leave users’ personal information exposed.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Automatic security updates
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes security vulnerabilities are found in products after they are sold to the public. For that reason,
        companies should have a way to quickly push a security update out to the product automatically so it fixes the
        security vulnerability without the consumer ever needing to worry about it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Delete the data it stores on you
      </h2>
      <p>
        Companies collect a lot of data on their consumers. Who controls that data? Being able to contact a company and
        ask them to delete any data they have on you is a very good thing.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Parental controls
      </h2>
      <p>
        Parental controls on toys, tablets, smart speakers, and many other connected devices can be a very good way to
        protect the privacy and security of both young and old. Not all products need parental controls, but parents
        should look to see if they are an option for connected products they will buy and let their children use.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Company manages security vulnerabilities
      </h2>
      <p>
        Security vulnerabilities in products happen. It’s how companies manage them when they arise that matter. We
        looked at whether or not companies have a system in place to manage vulnerabilities in the product when they
        are found. This includes having a point of contact for reporting vulnerabilities or an equivalent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program">bug bounty program</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        What could happen if something goes wrong
      </h2>
      <p>
        It’s likely nothing bad will happen with most of the products in this guide. However, it’s also good to think
        through what could happen if something goes wrong. We lay out a potential worst-case scenario for each product,
        in some cases for fun and in some cases based on things that have already happened with the product.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Updates
      </h2>
      <p>
        When news breaks or we come across a relevant article about a product in this guide, we will share it in the
        updates section on each product page.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Comments
      </h2>
      <p>
        We love to hear your thoughts and feedback on the products in this guide. And others users might like to join
        you in a conversation about any experiences or concerns you’ve had with a product. Please join the conversation
        in the comment section at the bottom of each product page.
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        Methodology
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you would like to read more about the research methodology we used to create this guide, <a href="https://medium.com/@harraton/how-we-evaluated-the-products-in-mozillas-privacy-not-included-buyer-s-guide-2018-6b122f885de0">here</a> is a post our
        researchers wrote about that.

        Why We Made This Guide
      </h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to version 2.0 of our *Privacy Not Included buyer’s guide. The goal is to help you shop smart—and
        safe—for products that connects to the internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last year we made version 1.0 of this guide. We didn’t know if people would be interested in a guide about the
        privacy and security of connected toys and smart home products. Turns out, they were. And it wasn’t just people
        who were interested. We discovered companies were too. It seems both consumers and companies are starting to
        see the value in connected products that are safe, secure, and private.
      </p>

      <p>
        We took the lessons learned last year and put them to work to build a better guide this year. What does that
        look like?
      </p>

      <h2 class="normal">
        This guide is more opinionated.
      </h2>
      <p>
        We realize people want to just know which products are safe and which aren’t. We are Mozilla—not a consumer
        product review company—so we won’t say “Buy this, don’t buy that.” Instead, we used our technical expertise to
        create a set of <a href="https://medium.com/read-write-participate/minimum-standards-for-tackling-iot-security-70f90b37f2d5">minimum security standards</a>
        we think all products should meet in order to be sold in stores. Those standards include using encryption,
        automatic security updates, requiring strong passwords, having a system to manage vulnerabilities, and having
        an accessible privacy policy. Look for the “Meets Our Minimum Security Standards” badge on products in the
        guide.

      </p>
      <h2 class="normal">
        There is a Creep-O-Meter.
      </h2>
      <p>
        We wanted users of this guide to be able to share their opinion too. It’s important companies, and other
        consumers, see which products people think are safe, and which products people feel are a bit creepy. So we
        created our Creep-O-Meter—a users rating on each product—to let folks give their opinion too. Try it out, it’s
        fun.
      </p>
      <h2 class="normal">
        Bigger and better.
      </h2>
      <p>
        We added a few things this year. Our product list has grown to 70 connected products across six categories.
        Last year we answered the questions “Can it spy on me?” and “What does it know about me?”. This year we added
        “Can I control it?” and “Does the company show it cares about consumers?” to that list. Hopefully the
        information provided in each product review will help people shop smart for connected products.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll notice a lot of <a href="https://medium.com/@harraton/how-we-evaluated-the-products-in-mozillas-privacy-not-included-buyer-s-guide-2018-6b122f885de0">research</a>
        went into this guide. Fortunately, we have access to some of the best minds around in the privacy and security
        space. Janice Y. Tsai, a privacy researcher here at Mozilla, and Rebecca Ricks, a former Mozilla Fellow, came
        together to comb through privacy policies and apps, and reach out to companies with questions about encryption
        and bug bounty programs. We were also lucky to collaborate with the smart researchers working on the Usable
        Privacy Policy project at Carnegie Mellon University. The reading levels of privacy policies come from their <a
          href="https://explore.usableprivacy.org/">Explore Usable Privacy</a>
        website. Check it out, it’s a great resource to quickly scan the content of privacy policies.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope you use and enjoy this guide to help you think about, shop for, and buy products that show they value
        privacy and security. We as consumers need to demand that value from the people who build our products. It’s
        how we’ll start to make the internet, and our lives, a bit safer in this digital world.
