            “In coming out to myself and close friends as transgender, <span>my biggest regret was turning to YouTube to hear the stories of other trans and queer people.</span> Simply typing in the
            word 'transgender' brought up countless videos that were essentially describing my struggle as a mental illness and as something that shouldn't exist. YouTube reminded me why I hid in the
            closet for so many years.

            Every now and then YouTube will continue to recommend me a video that tells me that my gender identity is wrong — and it reminds me of how much hate is squarely directed at me and people
            like me. I'm somewhat older, I've been dealing with these issues internally for a long time and I have therapy to work out these issues, but I can't imagine what it's like for those
            without access to help. <span>YouTube is a part of my pain in coming out</span> and is a reminder of how terrible this world can be to those who are different. I have to be proud in spite
            of places like YouTube.”
