      Our <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> buyer’s guide now comes with <em>*Privacy Not Included</em>
      warning labels on products we think consumers should think twice about before buying. It’s no
      small thing to assign such a label to a product, so we set ourselves some strict standards.
      If we can’t confirm a product meets our Minimum Security Standards, it automatically earned
      the <em>*Privacy Not Included label</em>, as we feel those standards are the minimum a product
      should meet to be on the market. We also look at how a company uses the data the product
      collects on you, how you can control the data the company collects, and what the company’s
      known track record is over the past two years for protecting their users’ data. How a company
      performed on these criteria determined if we assigned them the warning label. You will see
      little mini-warnings in our review section of the guide to help you understand what our concerns are.

      It’s likely nothing bad will happen with most of the products in this guide. However, it’s
      also good to think through what could happen if something goes wrong. We explain what
      concerns users should have about the product and often lay out a potential worst-case
      scenario—in some cases for fun and in some cases based on things that have already happened.

      Just because a device has a camera, microphone, or tracks location doesn’t mean it will
      snoop on you. It simply means it could and you should be aware of that. Also, many
      connected devices are controlled by apps on your phone. The apps often ask to use the
      phone’s camera, microphone or location tracking. Keep an eye on that, as some of the
      permissions the apps ask for might surprise you.

      just how much a company could be learning about you. The more information you give up,
      the better they may know you. Personal data includes things like name, email address,
      phone number, gender, age, and date of birth. Biometric data includes things like voice
      recordings, fingerprint, facial recognition, height, weight, heart rate, sleep data,
      menstrual cycles, and blood oxygen levels. Social data includes things like your contacts
      and friends or connections you have through a platform, like gamer friends through a

      Nearly every company collects some kind of information on its users. That’s how the internet
      works. It’s how they use and care for this information that matters. You should know
      whether a company shares or sells your personal information to others and for what reasons.
      This criteria is one of the criteria we use to determine if a product receives our
      <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> warning label. Companies that share or sell your data to

      It’s one thing for a company to say they care about their users’ privacy. It’s another
      thing to show. We looked at the track records of all the companies in the guide dating
      back to January, 2018 to see if they had known data breaches, security vulnerabilities,
      or other public privacy missteps. We found concerns ranging from small—an employee
      accidentally replying to all in an email exposing users email addresses—to large—corporate
      espionage and data breaches involving millions of users’ data. This criteria is one of
      the criteria we use to determine if a product receives our <em>*Privacy Not Included</em>

      a mini-warning label.

      Privacy information should be clear, readable, and communicate basic information to consumers
      about what happens to their data. Privacy policies are often written more for lawyers than
      consumers. That’s why it’s nice to see more and more companies creating consumer-friendly
      privacy pages to outline how they handle your personal information and the data they
      collected on their users. We hope to see this trend continue.

      We developed a set of minimum security standards we think all connected products should meet
      at the very least. Think of it as a “you must be this tall to ride” set of standards. These
      include five basic things: The product must use encryption, the company must provide
      automatic security updates, if a product uses a password, it must require a strong password,
      the company must have a way to manage security vulnerabilities found in their products,
      and the company must have an accessible privacy policy. If you would like to learn more

      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Encryption is your friend. It protects your private and personal information by scrambling it
      up into a code so that the only people or machines who can read it are the ones on the other
      end who have the key to unscramble that code. Products that don’t use encryption send personal
      information over the internet unscrambled so anyone can see it.

    <p id="security-updates"><strong>{% trans "Security updates" %}</strong></p>
    <p class="body">
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Sometimes security vulnerabilities are found in products after they are sold to the public.
      For that reason, companies should have a way to quickly push a security update out to the
      product automatically so it fixes the security vulnerability without the consumer ever
      needing to worry about it.

      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      Remembering passwords might be annoying, but having a good password is still one of the
      best lines of defense we have when it comes to protecting our privacy and security. It’s
      great when a password is required. But default passwords that are the same for all
      consumers and never change can be just as bad. You should be required to change the
      default password to a strong password. Products with a default password that does not
      require changing can leave users’ personal information exposed.

      Security vulnerabilities in products happen. It’s how companies manage them when they

      More and more products use artificial intelligence these days. It’s not just smart
      speakers and facial recognition in security cameras either. It’s AI in dog toys and
      fitness trackers and connected workout equipment. For our reviews, we defined AI as:
      “Changes are made to the product’s technology continually based on your user data.”
      What does all this mean for consumers? We’re just starting to understand. However,
      most consumers don’t know when AI is being used or how it may affect their experience.
      We believe companies should provide this information to consumers as AI-enabled products
      become more prevalent.

      One of the biggest issues surrounding artificial intelligence in our consumer products is
      having access to essential information about how AI-enabled features work. For example, what
      data does it collect and how does it use that information to make decisions for or about you.
      Knowing how it works lets users evaluate if there may be a chance of bias or ethical
      implications they should consider before using a product driven by AI.
