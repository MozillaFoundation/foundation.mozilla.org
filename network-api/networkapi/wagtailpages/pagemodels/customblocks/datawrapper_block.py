class DatawrapperBlock(blocks.EmbedBlock):
    """
    Embed block for Datawrapper visualizations.

    Currently, there is no limitation in the block itself on which oEmbed sources
    it can be used with. The available oEmbed source are limited in the settings
    and currently only includes Datawrapper.

    The block type mainly exists to provide a consistent help text to the editors.
    The help text should support editors in fining the correct URL in the Datawrapper
    dashboard.

    The current implementation of the block simply inserts the HTML from Datawrappers
    oEmbed response into the template. The response from Datawrapper includes the
    `iframe` element and a small `script` tag. The JS only adds some additional
    responsiveness features to the embed. If multiple embeds are used on the same page
    then the same `script` tag will be included multiple times on the page. This should
    not be much of an issue but only increase the length of the document a bit. If the
    repetition is considered an issue in the future, it should be possible to use the
    `options` settings for the Datawrapper oEmbed finder to modify the request so that
    the response only contains the `iframe`.
